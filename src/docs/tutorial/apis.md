title: API Tutorial
---

This section shows you how to access Taskcluster APIs programmatically.  The
examples use JavaScript (ES6) using the JavaScript [taskcluster
client](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-client) but apply to
[other supported languages](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries).

Note: the graphical Taskcluster tools on `tools.taskcluster.net` are all
written in client-side JavaScript using
[taskcluster-client-web](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-client-web),
the client library designed for use in browser frontends.
